This repository contains teaching materials for the lecture "Wissenschaftliches Rechnen auf Grafikkarten" given at the University of Regensburg.

Skript.pdf contains the lecture notes (still in german, english version under construction).

Aufgaben.pdf is an exercise sheet covering most of the topics (still in german, english version under construction).

The "example" folder and its subfolders contain examples for the lecture as well as some solutions for the exercises. The first few lines of the code are comments that explain the intention of the exercise and the compilation steps (if needed).
